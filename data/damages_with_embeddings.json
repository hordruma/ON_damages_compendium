A motion was brought alleging double recovery for future care costs and statutory benefits; motion dismissed. | Award will only be given if absolutely clear that benefits are certain to be received. There is a strict onus of proof and it must be patently clear that preconditions for an appropriate deduction have been established. It is uncertain if plaintiff will receive benefits.
