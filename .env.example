# OpenAI API Key (for expert report analysis)
# Get your key at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Anthropic API Key (alternative to OpenAI)
# Get your key at: https://console.anthropic.com/
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Note: You only need ONE of the above API keys to use the expert report analysis feature.
# If neither is set, the system will fall back to regex-based extraction (less accurate).

# For production deployment, use environment variables instead of .env file
# Example (Linux/Mac):
#   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
#   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
#
# Example (Windows):
#   set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
#   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
