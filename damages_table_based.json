Trial judge erred in declaring future cost of care damages as undisputed; Court of Appeal reduced those damages by $375,000. | Appeal allowed. Judgment reduced by $44,583.90 to reflect 2.5% interest rate on general damages. Obligation to assign income replacement benefits payable by RSA Insurance continues until respondent\u2019s 64th birthday. Trial judge erred in failing to instruct jury not to award drug benefits after age 65 (covered by Ontario Drug Benefit Program).

Plaintiff suffered soft tissue and spinal injuries, ongoing back pain, and lifelong emotional distress from death of son. Other plaintiffs (husband and two sons) had minor injuries and loss of guidance, care, and companionship. All five grounds of appeal dismissed; no bias found in trial judge\u2019s comments about threshold regulation. | Trial judge did not err in permitting an expert to rely on evidence from Statistics Canada. Trial judge did not err in considering evidence given by a registered psychologist. The damages for loss of care, guidance and companionship under the Family Law Act were not excessive as to reflect an error in principle. Trial judge\u2019s costs awards were proportionate.",
